1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Can I ask why? Do they feel awkward or catch on stuff?
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Do you find that the spikes make it difficult to walk/run around?
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Good
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,"@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike I copped both the white and black pair. Yea, I’m curious as to know as well. 🤔"
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike As much as “Off White Air Force 1” sounds appealing I passed on these and am not losing sleep over it. Here’s hoping more Virgil designs see general releases.
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,"@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike These are dope, straight up."
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Share some pics when you get done. I wanted to do that too.
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike I’m going to just keep the spikes and wear mine during winter in the snow!! I got the black pair though!
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Ima keep the spikes f it lol.

1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike I’m about to copy you lol
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Do that. I ordered the black ones.  Let us know how it goes with spikes off. Looking forward to an update.
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,"@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Still waiting on mine, but saw both colors in person at a show this weekend! 🔥🔥🔥 I removed plastic and shaved off spikes on another pair as well. Much better! https://t.co/KeHHc9fea7"
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,"@Rogerdodger410 @TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Sounds like a good reason to keep them! I prefer keeping shoes as is, so if I ever secure an OW with the spikes I’ll be sure to give them a chance. Appreciate the input my guy 🤝"
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,"@DirtySBs @TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike I can give a little input I’ve had the vapor streets and waffle racers, the spikes add a tad bit more comfort since you’re walking on soft rubber, and they add a lot of grip even when walking on smooth surfaces like tiles."
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel @snkr_twitr @OffWht @Nike Does it feel weird with the spikes when you walk on a hard surface?
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,@TheHypeModel Wow! What I was thinking!
1315902138858590208,ShadeTV c/o Marissa Hill,"@TheHypeModel A slide or foam runner? It has to be something comfy and not overly constricting, at least I think it does"

16723589,Liberty,Hello Twitter. I need technical help. Is there a layman-friendly way to download subtitles as text from videos on Amazon Prime or BBC iPlayer?
16723589,Liberty,"@krlwlzn On the other hand, it’s admirable when teachers create their own materials to help their students, especially in an EFL context where this is (I believe) more difficult."
16723589,Liberty,"@krlwlzn It’s intended to teach students how English uses metaphors to describe anger, but it does so in an unnatural and ungrammatical fashion."

16723589,Liberty,@noa_lange @krlwlzn Fascinating. Thank you!
16723589,Liberty,"@noa_lange @krlwlzn I thought it might be because of ethnic diversity - a single (Ashkenazi?) speaker might say a uvular r while others (Oriental, Slavic, African, French, etc.) might say it differently. Also, apparently women vary the way they say it a lot, while men are more 'conservative'."
16723589,Liberty,"@noa_lange @krlwlzn Interesting! I think I understand now. So, even if acoustic data says the sound is velar, it's still reasonable to transcribe it as uvular? And is that because the velar [ɣ] is closer to a g-sound?"
16723589,Liberty,@noa_lange @krlwlzn Interesting. I thought the uvular r in Hebrew might be due to Yiddish/German influence. (But this is all rather a lot of effort for a single phoneme. 🙄)
16723589,Liberty,"@noa_lange @krlwlzn The problem is that acoustic data says it's velar 80% of the time in a sampling of speech by Israelis, but single speech studies with X-ray images say it's uvular."
16723589,Liberty,"Specifically, I am trying to work out if the Hebrew /r/ is mostly velar or mostly uvular. Which turns out to be a huge can of worms."
16723589,Liberty,Linguists/phoneticians: is there a difference in the quality of information provided by acoustic data and X-ray photography or other imaging techniques? Can you work out place of articulation equally well with both?

16723589,Liberty,"@sphexish @reasonisfun Also, I think teachers in a school tend to be a ‘united front’: they take each other’s side in the event of conflict with students or outsiders."
16723589,Liberty,@sphexish @reasonisfun Only if you prevent them from interacting with anyone other than you.
16723589,Liberty,"@reasonisfun I don’t think conventional education aims at utopia. It’s more like, people should be hurt because going to school is virtuous."

Because people would think that you’re a sandwich topping."
16723589,Liberty,"@AskRamiRustom Good point. I hadn’t heard of that policy (I’ve only heard of whole families being arrested within NK), but it makes sense."
16723589,Liberty,"@AskRamiRustom Yes, it seems that people can oscillate. And it may depend on the situation. Introverted at parties but extroverted at work, etc."
16723589,Liberty,"@AskRamiRustom I’m really just asking for generalisations about whether introverts are well suited to teaching. In theory the answer is just “if you and the students enjoy it, then yes,” but there might be more to it in practice. For example, maybe teacher burnout happens more to introverts."
16723589,Liberty,"@krlwlzn I mean that teaching small groups requires more intense/continuous interaction between students and teacher, whereas interactions can be shorter or more broken up with large groups. (I’m assuming student centred learning and not just delivering a lecture.)"
16723589,Liberty,"@krlwlzn Aren’t large groups better for introverts in a way, since one can be more detached from each student?"

16723589,Liberty,"@realvantran But this isn't a mere wage gap. The fact that NK is a totalitarian state is no coincidence, as the state causes poverty by prohibiting trade and movement."
16723589,Liberty,"@AfricanDaBratt No. Sanctions were mostly imposed from 2006 after NK's first nuclear test. There were some sanctions before then, but they were relaxed in the 1990s for reasons unrelated to the famine."
16723589,Liberty,@CyberKulak Someone once gave me an example of a community somewhere in Africa whose literacy rates improved after schools were built.
16723589,Liberty,"@CyberKulak I think the view is that poorer people would be better off in state schools than in home education, essentially because they wouldn't have the time or resources that schools could offer."
16723589,Liberty,@AfricanDaBratt But the famine preceded any sanctions.
16723589,Liberty,"@realvantran Yes, similar problems of poverty exist everywhere. But almost nowhere is the contrast between ordinary people and political leadership so severe and grotesque as it is in NK."
16723589,Liberty,"@realvantran Farms in other countries have modern equipment. It's all done by hand (using basic tools) in North Korea. The farmers in that picture are also malnourished and sunburnt from manual labour. There are other differences too, but those ones are evident in the picture."
16723589,Liberty,"@realvantran Do you mean the fan? If so, then yes. The fact that the documentary makers only saw it during summer seemed bizarre, but that is perhaps just coincidental."
16723589,Liberty,"@NeilHud60657163 @crit_rat @DavidDeutschOxf Yes. I wonder if the type of introspection expressed by words like 'stress' (evidently not a word in Korean) is simply not a part of the culture, in addition to the lack of knowledge of alternatives."

16723589,Liberty,"@l1berty @krlwlzn Oh for sure, if there’s a variety of lects in the acoustic data (or simply free variation in the language – think the sharp t vs. glottal stop in British English ‘bottle’) that’s absolutely a factor!"
16723589,Liberty,"@l1berty @krlwlzn So even in Hebrew ‘lects where speakers pronounce the r as [ɣ], you’d (probably) transcribe it as /ʁ/ to show its relation to the r it shares with Yiddish/German etc."
16723589,Liberty,"@l1berty @krlwlzn And the r-like look of the ʁ and ʀ symbols stem from the shared areal trait between languages like French, German etc. that what is an alveolar r in related languages is uvular there."
16723589,Liberty,"@l1berty @krlwlzn You have to have some theory about what the phoneme is (e.g. what the speakers are aiming for), regardless of what the data says, to decide on a broad convention."

You can't avoid being ""brought down"" by life.

The stress on their joints isn't worth the minimal calories they'd burn.

I'd rather get them to focus on fixing their diet &amp; walking."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,I’m banned from the public library. They caught me moving all the vegan books to Fiction. 😎
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Eat half a grapefruit every day after I break my fast with a rib-eye and bacon. Never felt better. I also do avocado a couple days a week as well.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Only fruit you should consider is olives and avocados
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Berries only here.  Can't remember the last fruit?
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien No
I have cut it out
when I have included it, insulin goes up rapidly
Get knocked out of ketosis
I do have a few vegetables and some broth from meat/veg
V high fat works well for me - 3 teaspoons of butter/ tallow before a meal"
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@przegrales @CarnivoreSapien In a strict sense, sure. But in a discussion about a healthy, meat based diet, it’s fair game I think. What percentage of Americans would be miles better off if they ate a meat &amp; fruit diet?"
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@LifeMeansNature @CarnivoreSapien 🤣🤣🤣
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Saying “carnivore diet with fruit” is like saying “vegan diet with meat.”
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien Ever since I started sugarmaxxing (fruit, jam, honey) on carnivore I have been losing bodyfat and gaining muscle at a rate I've never seen before"
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien I do. I had a crazy sweet tooth before carnivore and it’s died down considerably. I like to have frozen blueberries and raspberries doused in heavy cream when I’m craving something sweet. Weight unchanged and I still feel great.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Fruit is a huge sugar trigger for me
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@RobyGolic @CarnivoreSapien Also, if we follow a diet like it’s a religion, we become insufferable."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien I'm still testing the carnivore diet with fruit, certain fruits like bananas don't suit me at all, while oranges are the exact opposite.  Honestly I feel best without sugar but I still have to test with fruit"
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien Fruit signals abundance.

Abundance of deez nuts! 😂"
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien If you aren’t including fruit you are limiting your virility IMO.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien I got fatter
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Harder to loose weight eating fruit but harder to build muscle when not. Normally have a small amount of fruit when trying to loose weight.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien I eat 5x more in general when adding fruit to my diet. Cant stop eating
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien Been having blueberries, some raspberries and the very occasional apple and banana. Not noticed a huge difference, I tend to have very small amounts. Saladino advocates fruit in carnivore, I think."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Yes at times and have seen that my BG is back to normal very soon…
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Not healthy enough for fruit.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien The question itself seems confused.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@shelly_187 @CarnivoreSapien Your strict
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Not had any fruit since 1st January
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien Other than avocado, I stay off fruits completely.
Haven't had fruits in 4 years."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien No. Still regulating my blood glucose &amp; fruit throws me off.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien If you don’t eat raspberries, you will get raspberries."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien For me adding fruit balanced my hormones and the fibre in the fruit made my bowel movements and digestion smoother.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien Yeah, recently brought fruit back in. Cramping in calves and abs stopped, also noticed an increase in sex drive."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien (3) so sad, during Chemo I also get 2 bags of glucose which for sure increase my BG.. Blood tests prior to Chemo shows my BG and it’s been around 7.8 to 9.5 over the past 6 months..Oh well. chemo ends today..I’ll get my health back on track soon."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien Some of us animal-based have trouble maintaining electrolytes, which results in heart palpitations. Sucks, but increasing good carbs assists with fluid retention."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien I perfer milk.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien No fruit at all.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien (1) Due to my current situation with Chemo, I’ve been recommended to consume alkaline fruit such as grapefruit, orange, strawberries, lemon, coconut, grapes, avocado, Melons, Cantaloupe and dates. I don’t eat all of them but good to know they’re low in GI.."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien When I do eat fruit I eat them with butter. Always.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien I’d like to know
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien If I add fruit I get hunger and reflux. No real change in energy.
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien (2) I like grapefruit, avocado, coconut, wee bit of orange and cantaloupe.. I don’t eat all of them together. I change everyday and eat only a very small amount due to my diabetes but need to increase my alkaline level."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien Carnivores by definition are not insulin resistant, so can utilize the small amount of sugar in many different ways. No problems. Metabolic flexibility. However if you have blood sugar or insulin levels, then it’s a metabolic disaster."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien I'm starting April 1st: only eggs honey butter red meat/fat/organs and minimal fruit (blueberries, avocados, pineapple) I'll report my findings."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien I feel better w/ fruit. No cramps, no need for electrolytes.

Did 2+ years without, think maybe some of that time without was necessary but now i function better with it."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien No, I am not including fruit in my carnivore diet."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien I feel great. workouts are better, noticed my singing voice is better and richer. sleep is better too."
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien Frozen blueberries mixed in homemade yoghurt is my treat. I don’t need to loose weight. But can’t loose any on  anything other than carnivore
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,"@CarnivoreSapien I've tried adding other things in, dairy primarily, and noticeable negative reactions. Nothing negative from fruit though. Body seems to like it. 🙂"
1392435206510944259,Carnivore Sapien 🥩,@CarnivoreSapien I've cycled fruit on &amp; off my entire carnivore journey. It has never stuck very long until this last time. I eat it prior to an am workout. Going on 3 months now. Better energy &amp; feeling of fulfillment. Minor digestion changes. Water weight adjusted now. Back to normal weight.👍

17663138,Maria Ho,"@AndrewMcMiillen @TuckonSports @BuffaloHanks @Ali_Nejad @jeffplatt @PokerGO @WSOP The situation at WSOP is very fluid. Day 3 doesn’t always start at final table, for ex. there were 40+ players that started day 3 of Monster Stack so we had to delay the stream until we reached the final table. That’s something that cannot be predicted. They are doing their best."
17663138,Maria Ho,@Geeky_Gonzo @thakidd99 @PokerGO @philivey @WSOP There’s an hour delay on the broadcast for game integrity reasons. A lot of people want to watch Ivey go for his 11th bracelet.

2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,So what’s the real way out? A political realignment that enables more genuine representation and accountability among leaders and reps. That sounds hard but it’s doable. Check us out at @Fwd_Party and let’s make it happen for the millions of unheard Americans out there.
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,Again all of this is irrelevant politically because our way of life is irrelevant to both parties except to drive anger and resentment. The immiseration of the American people - instead of being front and center - is simply a negative atmospheric condition.
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,Over 40% of American children are now born to single mothers - note again the uptick around 2000 and the decline in manufacturing. https://t.co/Y9k947WOUj

2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,"The media covers the character drama and the “news of the day” while people’s lives degrade, shorten and decline. Americans get angry and cast about for solutions - and the anger rises on both sides. So each party tries to channel the anger against the other. It’s a set up."
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,"I argued that it was the loss of 4 million manufacturing jobs in the Midwestern swing states that turned those states Republican. Dems shifted to Arizona, Georgia and Nevada for those electoral votes. In a two-party system, no one has to address anything. People are irrelevant. https://t.co/Co71O1pl9u"

2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,It’s a perverse result of the two-party system that spending millions to promote the extremist qualifies as ‘smart politics’ even as it increases the odds of bad unrepresentative leadership. Non-partisan open primaries and ranked choice voting would eliminate this incentive.

2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,What’s the way out? Non-partisan open primaries and #RankedChoiceVoting both would give the entire voting public a voice rather than the 10-15% who currently dominate closed party primaries. Also a break from the two-party system via a 3rd party @Fwd_Party
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,Even 30 years ago the two major parties were more ideologically similar and there were few counties that were landslides.

2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,It’s one reason why democracy reform via the @Fwd_Party or other effort is so important; the wave will keep growing in different forms and our current structures won’t hold up.
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,My take - of course it will. Others are already trying to pick up the mantle and follow in his footsteps. Breaking things / attacking is easier and going to be more fruitful for many than trying to rebuild institutional integrity.
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,Will Trumpism outlast Donald Trump?
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,Why the disconnect? 90% of districts are now safe seats and uncompetitive in the general. The system is rigged so that the vast majority of Americans have no meaningful say in who represents us. It’s only by unrigging this system - by both parties - do we have a shot at a fix.
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,"@AndrewYang Exactly. Its never as simple as the blue &amp; red teams would have us believe.

It’s supposed to be hard work. https://t.co/RXCT8BwxCH"
2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,"@AndrewYang It's like running around a table in a game of tag. If I go to one side and you go to the other, we can chase each other in perpetuity without ever accomplishing anything."

2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,"States should stop allocating electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. This requires no constitutional amendment. It would retain and strengthen the Electoral College while better aligning it with the popular vote, and it would better reflect independent and third-party votes."

2228878592,Andrew Yang🧢⬆️🇺🇸,"Trump is an acute threat to democracy.

Biden and Harris, the most likely 2024 Democratic nominees, are deeply unpopular.

Things can always change. But right now, America is headed for disaster.

If we're going on seniority alone, my ancestors built their first house in Nepean in 1809 or 1810 so let's get building."
6742522,Leigh Honeywell,"@Black_Isis There were a couple ""how many affordable units"" questions but the discourse isn't quite as sophisticated around that up here (for now)"
6742522,Leigh Honeywell,"Overall the only reason this wasn't as frustrating as a San Francisco housing review is that I know that the NIMBYs have fewer avenues to blockade stuff up here and the Official Plan supports this kind of density. The rhetoric was exactly the same, though."
6742522,Leigh Honeywell,@KevinBowrin Thanks Kevin!
6742522,Leigh Honeywell,"Partial credit to Alex N who wanted density, but not this one because this one doesn't ""serve the community's character"". Weaponizing ""missing middle"" discourse to try to block higher-density housing is a new one! To me anyway."
6742522,Leigh Honeywell,"Very frustrated at the amount of ""nobody wants this"" in the call tonight. While I felt like a bit of a lone non-developer voice wanting density, I guarantee that the 800 people who will hopefully have homes in a couple of years also want these homes to exist."

8255682,Adam Benayoun 💊,@Krugman25 The main question is if your money isn't better parked somewhere else. If we get ETF or they're closing down GBTC then it's  a 30% yield divided by the period. Anything above 3 years is probably not worth the risk holding this

8255682,Adam Benayoun 💊,@LevanonAdi Think of funds like rounds. Each one is technically a round and LPs may meet you at the first fund even tho they aren't investing in first time funds - but they want to build the relationship to invest in fund II or III.

Since you cannot build a green protocol on a resource-heavy chain, more builders will be attracted to build projects on Ethereum post-Merge

10/11"
1472283782581530631,Patricia | SuperPat.eth/.lens 📍🇪🇸 | ✈️ 🇫🇷,"Meanwhile, PoS will enhance the decentralisation of Ethereum and all the protocols building on top. 

Since capital is accessible by everyone, it removes the technical barriers eg. mining facilities for Ethereum to achieve better decentralisation and wider adoption

1472283782581530631,Patricia | SuperPat.eth/.lens 📍🇪🇸 | ✈️ 🇫🇷,"L2s will be very bullish as they share the security premise with the mainnet as the settlement layer, thus do not suffer from the same risks as bridges.

14986550,Andrew Badr,"alternative to the 'random' sort -- instead of picking items to compare, pick uniformly from the shrinking set of pairwise comparisons which we don't know the answer to.

the running time of either of these versions (in # of compares) seems to say something general about sorting"
14986550,Andrew Badr,"ofc the inference isn't free. so in practice you would want to eliminate inferred comparisons as you go along. iterative transitive closure?

big-O probably gets bigger, but not in the # of comparisons, which is the only running time I care about. (fin)"
14986550,Andrew Badr,"one fun (?) starting thought - a sorting algorithm that proceeds by picking two items uniformly at random from the set, then compares them iff it can't already infer their ranking from previous compares.

assuming that inference is ""free"", what's the running time of this algo?"
14986550,Andrew Badr,"(would be nice if it also easily generalizes to the case where we only want a sorted top-k of n, rather than total ordering)"
14986550,Andrew Badr,"in particular, my intuition says that people will get tired/annoyed if they see the same item repeatedly, or even in too close of proximity (""fatigue""). you start to tune it out. especially for the subjective-ranking cases i want. what's a n*logn algorithm that minimizes fatigue?"
14986550,Andrew Badr,"thinking out loud about sorting algorithms. in particular, ones designed for people pairwise comparing items from a set (subjectively!), trying to get a total ordering.

you could run quicksort or mergesort and ask the person for each comparison, but i think that's not ideal— 1/n"

894339217412816896,pourteaux,"@skwp why build this fragility into bitcoin? if btc just replaces gold and not usd, it’s a success. if it just replaces 25% of gold it’s a success. hyperbtcization narrative reminds me of dead narratives of the past, eg where we said btc was the reserve asset of crypto (til it wasn’t)."
894339217412816896,pourteaux,"@skwp Yes, it would be presumptuous in ‘93 to state that the internet is only a success if there are 300M mobile users (as today). Why set that expectation? There are successes short of this.

There are *many* scenarios short of hyperbitcoinization that I’d still consider a success for btc and find it counterproductive to pin it to a CMC rank."
894339217412816896,pourteaux,@skwp (1/2) yes that is the point of my tweet. there are so many ways for btc to not be #1 that it is senseless to build this expectation into bitcoin.
894339217412816896,pourteaux,@skwp A better analogy: Let's presume btc does Pierre's speculative attack on gold and USD. It is still easily eclipsed by tokenized derivatives and equities if they are all on SOL or ETH etc. https://t.co/2OSUbgXh9j

1394312518408019968,dusttoodigital,"@JesseDrucker @dusttodigital I imagine that one of their videos was subject to some type of copyright claim (weird because it seems like the definition of fair use), and twitter has suspended their account until they delete it. I hope they come back soon though—one of my favorite follows"
1394312518408019968,dusttoodigital,@LaChapellePete @dusttodigital I wonder whether it was for copyright infringement. (That’s just a guess. But I loved @dusttodigital amd hope to see them again in one form or another.)
1394312518408019968,dusttoodigital,What did @dusttodigital get suspended for? Did they get hacked?
1394312518408019968,dusttoodigital,"@punkademic @Twitter @TwitterSupport And I was wondering what happened to the @dusttodigital tweet of Marvin Gaye performing in Washington, DC, that I RT’ed. That account brings so much joy to so many people."
1394312518408019968,dusttoodigital,"@SpinningGoth @TwitterSafety @dusttodigital My guess is perhaps an issue with recording or video copyrights?
Whatever it is, I hope it's resolved soon, they are one of my 'happy places' on here when I've seen enough toxicity."

It's more than a word: if you carry that weight you can use it, if you don't- don't."
10838882,𝚋𝚕𝚊𝚌𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚟𝚎,@BlackDave The community is generally pretty chill haven’t heard anyone say it so i doubt anyone wants to be seen as boorish. But i use the term in my everyday life periodically so….

Be ready, and be kind to yourself."

10838882,𝚋𝚕𝚊𝚌𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚟𝚎,@BlackDave So hard to figure that out. And then you have to figure out when you transition from content creator to business owner and all the weird shot that comes with that.

141817380,Anitta,"@thalesoares @Thiersoares E mais uma vez nenhuma citação sobre o possível desencadeamento de cistite de repetição NAO BACTERIANA. Ou seja, mulheres... não é fácil pra gente não"
141817380,Anitta,"@helldias000 @joanasuarez Amore não achei nada nessa matéria falando sobre cistite de lua de mel. Se encontrar alguma que NÃO fale que é ""bactéria"" ou alergia à sabonete e perfume (acredite até isso eu já tentei ficar sem). Você me manda pleaseeee"
141817380,Anitta,"Enfim... minha cirurgia tá marcada e aqui fica meu apelo por mais informações para as mulheres. Mais acesso, mais interesse geral em cuidar do corpo feminino para que a gente possa ser livre e conseguir se cuidar"
141817380,Anitta,"isso pq encontrei meu namorado pouco no meio dessa trabalheira toda. Ou o artigo já começa com ""as bactérias bla bla bla""... NAO TEM BACTERIAAAAAAA"
141817380,Anitta,"matéria, artigo, site etc cogita a cistite de repetição como um possível sintoma de endometriose. Aliás você pesquisa cistite no Google e os artigos já começam falando ""podem chegar a se repetir por 4 vezes em um ano"".... amooooor só esse mês eu já tive 6 vezesssss."
141817380,Anitta,"9 anos dessa novela e eu já tentei de TUDO que todos os tipos de médicos ja falaram. Todas as dicas, conselhos, técnicas que os médicos deram ou do Google também já tentei. E NADA. (e 9 anos deu foi tempo de eu tentar solução hein) porém NUNCA me pediram uma ressonância. Nenhuma"
141817380,Anitta,"E é isso galera... da América à Europa sem dormir pq a dor fala mais alto que tudo. Você não consegue se concentrar num livro, num filme, nada. Só dar Google em como resolver esta merda... e é inacreditável a falta de informação que a mulher tem que passar viu."
141817380,Anitta,@alinecristinags Pois vamos dar as mãos
141817380,Anitta,@33geg A dor não deixa. Tô morrendo de sono mas a dor não deixa eu dormir
141817380,Anitta,"Quantos especialistas no twitter, eu fico passada. 👏🏽👏🏽 Galerinha bem informada, joga no Google o significado da palavra infecção. Se NÃO TEM BACTÉRIA não é infecção urinária. A dor é a mesma? Eu sei lá! não tenho bactéria pra saber. Dever ser, sei la. Só sei que dói pra caralho"
141817380,Anitta,@ThiagoResiste Pois me diga quem é esse médico pelo amor de Deus. Esse remédio essa doença que eu peço pra minha médica investigar também
141817380,Anitta,@mhrc_ Já passei meses fazendo isso aí pq mais um genio recomendou (pedir uma ressonância que era bom nada). Só gastei tempo e dinheiro

Sempre ouvia: ""é higiene"". 9 anos ouvindo isso a Larissinha parece até um cristal esculpido de tanto cuidado, o povo pergunta ate se eu fiz plastica (sei la se existe) hahaha mas nada da dor sumir. Tem que ir + de 1"
141817380,Anitta,@recavalcante2 @anittxsiegel Vc fez cirurgia? Pq minha amiga tinha as mesmas coisas que eu. Operou e nunca mais sentiu nada. 3 anos já vida normal
141817380,Anitta,Ahhhh gente e em alguns casos a endometriose pode causar infertilidade ou aborto espontâneo. Quanto mais tempo sem o tratamento ou a cirurgia mais arriscado fica. Aquela dor INSUPORTÁVEL quando menstrua tb pode ser isso. Esses dias fiz show dançando que nem uma pata
141817380,Anitta,"@soutamires_sp Sem falar os homi bosta q acha q a mulher tá inventando a dor só pra não transar. aí q a coitada fica sem saída mesmo se não conseguir se impor. O meu me arrastou pra consulta, pediu pro médico traduzir e quando cheguei em casa dia seguinte ele sabia mais de endometriose q eu rs"
141817380,Anitta,@hunters3004 Não pode fazer muito esforço por um mês. Tive que cancelar muita coisa mas era isso ou morrer de dor não só depois do ato mas também quando menstrua. Precisávamos agir rápido. 9 anos nesse sofrimento
141817380,Anitta,"é só o choro. Endometriose. Pesquisem artigos sérios no Google (ainda é um assunto :meio"" novo então não tem tannnnnnta informação) mas um médico especialista nisso vai conseguir te ajudar. Enquanto isso tô aqui contando os dias pra minha cirurgia. Dizem que é bem simples"
141817380,Anitta,"Procurem mais de um médico, mais de uma opinião. Se um não resolver... vai pra outro até resolver. Não é normal a gente viver com essa dor assim pra sempre. Tô eu aqui no aviao e nem consigo dormir pq fui comemorar com o boy as vitórias que a vida tá me dando esses dias e agora"
141817380,Anitta,"Pesquisem, galera. A endometriose é muito comum entre as mulheres. Tem vários efeitos colaterais, em cada corpo de um jeito. Podem se estender até a bexiga e causar dores terríveis ao urinar. Existem varios tratamentos. O meu terá que ser cirurgia."
141817380,Anitta,Falta de higiene? Não. Falta de preservativo? Não. Falta de água? Não. Falta de pesquisar a fundo todas as variáveis que cada corpo pode responder a uma anomalia? SIM
141817380,Anitta,"A doutora (enviada pelo meu anjo da guarda só pode), fez na mesma hora uma ressonância em mim e estava la. ENDOMETRIOSE. No dia seguinte ela me levou em um especialista em endometriose. Fizemos os outros exames necessários pra ter certeza e aí está"
141817380,Anitta,"Pois bem galera... fui ficar com meu pai no hospital aquela vez. Comentei com minha querida amiga anja Dra que comanda tudo lá, que eu tava em tempo de morrer de dor. Ela fez meu milionésimo exame e pela milionésima vez... NAO TEM BACTÉRIA. Nunca teve em nenhum dos exames"
141817380,Anitta,"Era insinuando que eu não uso preservativo? (Alô DST, hein, saí ilesa dessa população inteira mundial que já passou por aqui só na base da sorte e do milagre? Poooouuuurrrannn)"
141817380,Anitta,Quando li essas matérias pensei... esses senhores me examinaram e eu nao to sabendo? Para estar escrevendo um artigo com meu nome sobre o meu problema de saúde? Tavam querendo dizer que eu não tenho higiene? (logo eu a obcecada pelo cuidado com a minha larissinha)
141817380,Anitta,Acreditem. A dor é tão ruim que você quer fazer de TUDO pra que isso passe. Então obviamente nesses meus 9 anos de luta eu passei foi por gente me dizendo as mesmas coisas... e nada de resolver.
141817380,Anitta,Eles diziam que a higiene era muito importante. O uso de preservativo. Urinar após a relação. Beber muita água. E outras coisinhas que eu nos meus 9 anos de sofrimento já estava cansada de escutar.
141817380,Anitta,"E que toda vez que eu tinha relação com o piu piu mais avantajado eu não tinha condições nem de andar no dia seguinte ou 48h depois de tanta dor. Pois logo em seguida vários portais e sites de médicos fizeram matérias ensinando ""como evitar a infecção urinária de Anitta""."
141817380,Anitta,"Então vou compartilhar uma coisa com vocês que na época fiquei sem reação mas agora eu tenho um laudo pra rebater. Uma vez eu falei num podcast ou alguma outra entrevista, que não lembro agora, que eu sofria de uma cistite de lua de mel terrível."
141817380,Anitta,"Pois eu tenho uma dúvida genuína..  alguém aqui, além de mim, sofre de cistite de repetição e já tentou tudo quanto foi remédio, técnica, laser, botox e etc pra não morrer de dor 24h depois do ato sexual?"
141817380,Anitta,"Vamos, galera, mulheressss. Estou aqui no auge dos acontecimentos mais inacreditáveis da minha vida um atrás do outro tipo um rajadão de bênçãos... mas num ta dando pra sorrir por motivos de: precisamos falar sobre endometriose"
