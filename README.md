# NLP Twitter Project

The goal of this project was to build a recommendation model that recommends 2nd degree Twitter users to follow based on the each users collective tweets, retweets and likes. I scraped approximately 19,700 from 106 different Twitter accounts using Twitters Tweepy API, and I used nature language processing, topic modeling, and distance calculations to determine the top 10 most similar accounts based on my Twitter preferences.
